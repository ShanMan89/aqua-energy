        <h1>About Rainwater Harvesting</h1>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting is the practice of collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops, land surfaces, or rock catchments for later use. This collected water can be used for various purposes such as landscape irrigation, toilet flushing, laundry, and even as a potable water source after appropriate filtration and purification. Implementing a rainwater harvesting system can help homeowners reduce their reliance on municipal water supplies, lower utility bills, and contribute to water conservation efforts, especially in regions prone to drought.</p>
        <p>A typical system includes a catchment surface (like a roof), gutters and downspouts to channel the water, a filtration system to remove debris, a storage tank (cistern), and a distribution system. The effectiveness and design of a rainwater harvesting system depend on local rainfall patterns, roof size, water demand, and intended uses of the water. It's an ancient practice that is regaining popularity as a sustainable way to manage water resources.</p>
