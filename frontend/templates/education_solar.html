        <h1>About Solar Power</h1>
        <p>Solar power is a renewable energy source that harnesses sunlight to generate electricity for your home. Photovoltaic (PV) panels, typically installed on rooftops, convert sunlight directly into electricity (DC power), which is then converted by an inverter into usable AC power for your household appliances. By installing a solar PV system, homeowners can significantly reduce their electricity bills, decrease their carbon footprint, and increase their energy independence.</p>
        <p>The amount of solar energy a system can generate depends on several factors, including geographic location (solar irradiance), panel orientation and tilt, shading from trees or buildings, and the overall efficiency of the system components. Many governments and local utilities offer incentives, such as tax credits or rebates, to encourage solar adoption, making it a more affordable investment for sustainable living.</p>
